He earned an award for outstanding laboratory mentorship of undergraduates in PURSUE, a NASA-funded program that encourages under-represented people in science.  After completing his Ph.D., Chad won a post-doctoral fellowship from the National Research Council (part of the National Academies) to carry out research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, CO. Together with his team, he performed groundbreaking experiments on a new optical atomic clock based on laser-cooled and -trapped ytterbium atoms. His research interests include atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics, and this work is carried out in Bethel's new AMO lab with undergraduate physics and engineering majors. Dr. Hoyt has helped develop and lead advanced lab-based courses in Optics and Lasers. Open-ended student projects in these courses have included nonlinear optics (Z-scan measurements and frequency doubling), atomic and molecular spectroscopy, laser cooling and trapping, building HeNe lasers, holographic and interferometric measurements, and precision measurements with physical optics. He has recently worked with talented Bethel students to cool and trap lithium atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). Dr. Hoyt has been or currently is a reviewer for 6 different international physics journals and for National Science Foundation grant proposals.

His dissertation comprised some of the first observations of laser cooling in solids, for which he was awarded a $10,000 prize by the Optical Society of America and New Focus, Inc. He earned an award for outstanding laboratory mentorship of undergraduates in PURSUE, a NASA-funded program that encourages under-represented people in science.  After completing his Ph.D., Chad won a post-doctoral fellowship from the National Research Council (part of the National Academies) to carry out research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, CO. Together with his team, he performed groundbreaking experiments on a new optical atomic clock based on laser-cooled and -trapped ytterbium atoms. His research interests include atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics, and this work is carried out in Bethel's new AMO lab with undergraduate physics and engineering majors. Dr. Hoyt has helped develop and lead advanced lab-based courses in Optics and Lasers. Open-ended student projects in these courses have included nonlinear optics (Z-scan measurements and frequency doubling), atomic and molecular spectroscopy, laser cooling and trapping, building HeNe lasers, holographic and interferometric measurements, and precision measurements with physical optics. He has recently worked with talented Bethel students to cool and trap lithium atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). Dr. Hoyt has been or currently is a reviewer for 6 different international physics journals and for National Science Foundation grant proposals.
