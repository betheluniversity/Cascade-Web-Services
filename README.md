# Bethel University Tinker

Tinker is comprised of a handful of modules, most of which interact with Cascade (cms.bethel.edu).

## Events
Create, edit, and delete Events in Cascade.

## E-Announcements
Create, edit, and delete E-Announcements in Cascade. Automatically creates and sends E-Announcements via delivery.bethel.edu (cron).

## Faculty Bios
Create, edit, and delete Faculty Bios in Cascade.

# Admin 
## Redirects
Manage redirects for www.bethel.edu. These get applied to the Apache code on the server.

## Publisher
Publishes all pages that contain a program feed. This module has been reduced, since we upgraded to Cascade v8.

## Sync Metadata
Updates Metadata Sets in Cascade for every instance. Also allows us to manage metadata in version control.

## Program Search Tags
Create, edit, and delete Program Search tags that get used by the Program Search on www.bethel.edu.

## News
Automatically sends news emails via delivery.bethel.edu, when a news article is published in Cascade (publish trigger). This has no front-end interface.
